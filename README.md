## Contributing

Don't edit these files:

- /static/assets/spec.js
- /static/contents/spec/*.md

These files are automatically generated by the Sisk core XML documentation. If something is wrong there, you must edit it in the member summary docs.

## Building docs

To build HTML specification files, you must compile Sisk in the Release configuration. Make sure you have this snippet
in your `Sisk.Core.csproj`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'">
	<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>
</PropertyGroup>
```

After that you can compile eng/GenerateMdDoc and run it with the generated `Sisk.Core.xml` from the Sisk build:

```powershell
PS .\GenerateMdDoc.exe Sisk.HttpServer.xml
```

It's necessary to create an directory called `Output` next to the `GenerateMdDoc.exe` before running it.
