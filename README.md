# Sisk website

Sisk website, documentation and specification, written in HTML and Javascript. Generator written in C#.

You can visit the Sisk website from [this link](https://sisk.proj.pw/).

## Contributing

Do not edit files under `/static/view/spec`!

These files are automatically generated by the Sisk core XML documentation. If something is wrong there, you must edit it in the member summary docs.

## Building docs

To build HTML specification files, you must compile Sisk in the Release configuration. Make sure you have this snippet
in your `Sisk.Core.csproj`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'">
	<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>
</PropertyGroup>
```

After that you can compile eng/GenerateMdDoc and run it with the generated `Sisk.Core.xml` from the Sisk build:

```powershell
PS .\GenerateMdDoc.exe Sisk.HttpServer.xml
```

It's necessary to create an directory called `Output` next to the `GenerateMdDoc.exe` before running it.
