# Overridable headers

Proposed to version 0.15.

Status: included in production release 0.15.

Overloadable headers is a way to ensure that these headers are sent at the end of the response. You can override headers generated by the HTTP server, the CORS processor, or your object's final response.

The `HttpContext.OverrideHeaders` property is an NameValueCollection which stores these headers. The initial motivation for this feature was the need to replace CORS headers in a single response, without having to handle it globally for all responses. Also, an IRequestHandler can set this header as well and remove the responsibility from the callback.

```cs
public class PublicCorsRequestHandler : IRequestHandler
{
    public RequestHandlerExecutionMode ExecutionMode { get; init; } = RequestHandlerExecutionMode.BeforeContents;

    public HttpResponse? Execute(HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
    {
        context.OverrideHeaders.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        return null;
    }
}

[RouteGet("/")]
[RequestHandler(typeof(PublicCorsRequestHandler))]
public IEnumerable<User> Index(HttpRequest request)
{
    return Users.ToArray();
}
```

That way, accessing the above route you are guaranteed that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header will be sent, even if the response headers or CORS headers is set to an different value.
