# Routing

The router refers to what redirects requests to their proper places. A [Router](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Router) is responsible for routing [Route](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Route) to its responsible controllers, methods or callbacks. What the Router uses to match a route with a Route is the request path and its method. These two items are responsible for assigning a request to a route.

```cs
mainRouter.SetRoute(RouteMethod.Get, "/hey", (request) =>
{
    return new HttpResponse() { Content = new StringContent("Hello!") };
});

// alternative way using the + operator
mainRouter += new Route(RouteMethod.Get, "/", (req) =>
{
    return new HttpResponse()
    {
        Content = new StringContent("...world"),
        Status = HttpStatusCode.Ok
    };
});
```

To understand what a route is capable of doing, we need to understand what a request is capable of doing. An [HttpRequest](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpRequest) will contain everything you need. Sisk also includes some extra features that speed up the overral development.

# Creating routes using paths

You can define routes using SetRoute methods.

```cs
mainRouter.SetRoute(RouteMethod.Get, "/hey/<name>", (request) =>
{
    string name = request.Query["name"]!; // name will never be null in this context
    return request.CreateOkResponse($"Hello, {name}");
});

// or multiple parameters
mainRouter.SetRoute(RouteMethod.Get, "/hey/<name>/surname/<surname>", (request) =>
{
    string name = request.Query["name"]!;
    string surname = request.Query["surname"]!;
    return request.CreateOkResponse($"Hello, {name} {surname}!");
});
```

The HTTP request [Query](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpRequest.Query) property also stores the content of an original query, but if there are parameters in the route with the same name as a query, it will be replaced by what is in the route. The path that is matched with an request URI is always the path as explained in [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3).

You can also get an query parameter, including an route parameter, casting it to the desired type, with [GetQueryValue](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpRequest.GetQueryValue(string).md):

```cs
mainRouter.SetRoute(RouteMethod.Get, "/user/<id>", (request) =>
{
    Guid id = request.GetQueryValue<Guid>("id");
});
```

Internally, the implementation of this method differs from .NET 6 to newer versions of .NET that did not yet implement `IParsable`, so to make it compatible, some converters were implemented manually. You can see the [supported types here](https://github.com/sisk-http/core/blob/main/src/Internal/Parseable.cs).

> **Note:**
>
> Paths have their trailing `/` ignored in both request and route path, that is, if you try to access a route defined as `/index/page` you'll be able to access using `/index/page/` too.
>
> You can also force URLs to terminate with `/` enabling the [ForceTrailingSlash](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpServerFlags.ForceTrailingSlash) flag.

# Creating routes using class instances

You can also define routes dynamically using reflection with the attribute [RouteAttribute](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.RouteAttribute). This way, the instance of a class in which its methods implement this attribute will have their routes defined in the target router.

Methods marked with the route attribute must be static.

```cs
public class MyController
{
    // will be reached as an instance form
    [Route(RouteMethod.Get, "/")]
    HttpResponse Index(HttpRequest request)
    {
        HttpResponse res = new HttpResponse();
        res.Content = new StringContent("Index!");
        return res;
    }

    // static methods only be reached when setting the object type
    [Route(RouteMethod.Get, "/hello")]
    static HttpResponse Hello(HttpRequest request)
    {
        HttpResponse res = new HttpResponse();
        res.Content = new StringContent("Hello world!");
        return res;
    }
}
```

Then you can define the routes of the MyController instance:

```cs
var myController = new MyController();
mainRouter.SetObject(myController);
```

Alternatively, you can define your members statically, without an instance, by passing the class's type as a parameter:

```cs
mainRouter.SetObject(typeof(MyController));
```

Since Sisk version 0.16, it is possible to enable AutoScan, which will search for user-defined classes that implement `RouterModule` and will automatically associate it with the router. This method is experimental and is not supported by Native AOT.

```cs
mainRouter.AutoScanModules<ApiController>();
```

# Regex routes

Instead of using the default HTTP path matching methods, you can mark a route to be interpreted with Regex.

```cs
Route indexRoute = new Route(RouteMethod.Get, @"\/[a-z]+\/", "My route", IndexPage, null);
indexRoute.UseRegex = true;
mainRouter.SetRoute(indexRoute);
```

You can also capture groups from the regex pattern into the [Request.Query](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpRequest.Query.md) contents:

```cs
[RegexRoute(RouteMethod.Get, @"/uploads/(?<filename>.*\.(jpeg|jpg|png))")]
static HttpResponse RegexRoute(HttpRequest request)
{
    string? filename = request.Query["filename"];
    return new HttpResponse().WithContent($"Acessing file {filename}");
}
```

# Any method routes

You can define a route to be matched only by its path and skip the HTTP method. This can be useful for you to do method validation inside the route callback.

```cs
// will match / on any HTTP method
mainRouter.SetRoute(RouteMethod.Any, "/", callbackFunction);
```

# Ignore case route matching

By default, the interpretation of routes with requests are case-sensitive. To make it ignore case, enable this option:

```cs
mainRouter.MatchRoutesIgnoreCase = true;
```

This will also enable the option `RegexOptions.IgnoreCase` for routes where it's regex-matching.

# Not Found (404) callback handler

You can create a custom callback for when a request doesn't match any known routes.

```cs
mainRouter.NotFoundErrorHandler = () =>
{
    return new HttpResponse(404)
    {
        // Since v0.14
        Content = new HtmlContent("<h1>Not found</h1>")
        // older versions
        Content = new StringContent("<h1>Not found</h1>", Encoding.UTF8, "text/html")
    };
};
```

# Method not allowed (405) callback handler

You can also create a custom callback for when a request matches it's path, but doens't match the method.

```cs
mainRouter.MethodNotAllowedErrorHandler = () =>
{
    return new HttpResponse(405)
    {
        Content = new StringContent($"This request is only GET request!")
    };
};
```

# Internal error handler

Route callbacks can throw errors during server execution. If not handled correctly, the overall functioning of the HTTP server can be terminated. The router has a callback for when a route callback fails and prevents service interruption.

This method is only reacheable when [ThrowExceptions](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpServerConfiguration.ThrowExceptions.md) is false.

```cs
mainRouter.CallbackErrorHandler = (ex, req) =>
{
    return new HttpResponse(500)
    {
        Content = new StringContent($"Error: {ex.Message}")
    };
};
```
