# Property AllowOrigins

## Definition
Namespace: Sisk.Core.Entity

```csharp
public string[] AllowOrigins { get; set; }
```

From MDN: Access-Control-Allow-Origin specifies either a single origin which tells browsers to allow that origin to access the resource; or else — for requests without credentials — the "*" wildcard tells browsers to allow any origin to access the resource.
