# Property AllowCredentials

## Definition
Namespace: Sisk.Core.Entity

```csharp
public bool AllowCredentials { get; set; }
```

From MDN: The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true. When used as part of a response to a preflight request, this indicates whether or not the actual request can be made using credentials.
